# Izacu

Izacu is a simple movie-browsing website where users can enter without registration and freely explore available movies. The goal of Izacu is to provide a clean, fast, and distraction-free experience where visitors can watch films without logging in, leaving comments, or giving ratings. The website also includes an admin dashboard that will later provide movie management tools, database analytics, and visitor insights.

The entire project is still under development, and many features are being added step by step.
